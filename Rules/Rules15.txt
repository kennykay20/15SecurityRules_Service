Here are the 15 rules to build secure and robust APIs in ASP .NET Core:
1. - Enforce HTTPS using middleware and redirect all HTTP traffic
2. - Secure endpoints with [Authorize] and JWT authentication
3. - Validate JWT tokens including issuer, audience, and expiry
4. - Use role-based, policy-based, claim-based, or custom authorization instead of hardcoded values
5. - Apply strict input validation on all incoming models
6. - Use DTOs to prevent over-posting and data injection
7. - Configure CORS to allow only trusted origins and methods
8. - Suppress detailed error messages in production 
9. - Implement rate limiting to block brute-force and abuse
10. - Avoid logging tokens, passwords, and sensitive user data
11. - Add security headers like HSTS and X-Content-Type-Options
12. - Regularly update NuGet packages to fix known vulnerabilities
13. - Set cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes
14. - Remove unused endpoints and unnecessary controllers
15. - Use strong password policies if handling users.
